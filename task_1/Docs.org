2. Identify scalability and fault-tolerance issues/3. Discuss the identified issues

+ S1. Resource usage
  - no big problem for the frontend (most logic is on client side), but backend express and the database will have problems with an increased number of users and requests.
  - scalability

+ S2. Shared state
  - We have a single database which can't be divided?
  - scalability

+ S4. Blocking operations
 - We have no mechanism to handle long database quires
 - Neither do we have a limits on request spam
 - scalability

3. Fault tolerance – aspects to consider

+ FT1. Single points of failure
  - If any component fails (frontend, backend or database), nothing works.
  - fault-tolerance concern 

+ FT2. Error handling
  - If the backend has an error/failure it will return an error/fail response
  - if we missed coding in it express will give its own error and continue as nothing happened  
  - most important errors have been checked
  - fault-tolerance concern

+ FT4. Restart and recovery
  - When running the docker production file every components restarts if fail
  - If backend doesn't find database it doesn’t try to reconnect
  - But session state is lost from the backend
  - fault- tolerance concern

+ FT5. Observability
  - We can observe in logs errors
  - Frontent will not check backend status
  - fault-tolerance concern
